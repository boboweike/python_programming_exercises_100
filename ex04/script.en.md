# Exercise 4(Level 1) ~ Generate list and tuple

Hello everyone, welcome back to our Python programming exercises series. Today we're going to tackle another Level 1 problem, which is perfect for beginners.

Our task today is to write a Python program that accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from the console and generates a list and a tuple containing every number.

Let's dive into the code:

```python
def generate_list_and_tuple():
    # Get the input from the user
    numbers = input("Enter numbers separated by commas: ")

    # Split the string into a list where each element is a number
    list_numbers = numbers.split(',')

    # Convert the list to a tuple
    tuple_numbers = tuple(list_numbers)

    # Return the list and the tuple
    return list_numbers, tuple_numbers

# Test the function
print(generate_list_and_tuple())
```

In this code, we first get the input from the user. We then split the string into a list where each element is a number. After that, we convert the list to a tuple. Finally, we return the list and the tuple.

When we test this function with the input '34,67,55,33,12,98', it correctly outputs the list ['34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98'] and the tuple ('34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98').

In smmary, the main Python syntax covered in this exercise are:

- Getting input from the console
- String manipulation, specifically the split() method
- Lists and tuples, including how to convert a list to a tuple

That's it for today's lesson. I hope you found it helpful and interesting. Stay tuned for more Python exercises!
