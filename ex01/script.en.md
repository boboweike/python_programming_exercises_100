Welcome everyone to our "Python Programming Practice 100 Examples" series. I'm excited to guide you through our very first problem. If you're a beginner, don't worry; we'll go through everything step by step. Let's get started!

**Introduction to the Problem:**

Today's task is to write a simple Python program. This program will find all numbers between 2000 and 3200 that are divisible by 7 but not a multiple of 5. And we want to print these numbers in a single line, separated by commas. Sounds interesting, right? Let's crack this!

**Step-by-Step Coding:**

Before we begin, make sure your Python environment is ready. Open your text editor or IDE and let's start coding.

**Step 1: Loop Through Numbers**

First, we'll loop through each number from 2000 to 3200. We use a 'for' loop and Python's `range` function for this. Here's what you should type:

```python
for number in range(2000, 3201):
```

Notice how we use 3201 because 'range' stops right before the end number.

**Step 2: Check the Conditions**

Now, within our loop, let's check if each number fits our two conditions: divisible by 7 and not by 5. We'll use an 'if' statement. Here it goes:

```python
if number % 7 == 0 and number % 5 != 0:
```

Here, `%` helps us find the remainder of division. If a number is perfectly divisible by 7, the remainder is 0. And if it's not a multiple of 5, the remainder will not be 0.

**Step 3: Collect and Print Valid Numbers**

Before the loop, we'll set up a list to hold our valid numbers. Just above your loop, add:

```python
valid_numbers = []
```

Whenever we find a number that meets our criteria, we'll add it to this list. Inside the 'if' block, add:

```python
valid_numbers.append(str(number))
```

We convert the number to a string because later we'll join these strings together with commas.

**Step 4: Join and Print the List**

After the loop ends, we want to print all valid numbers in one line, separated by commas. Add this line after your loop:

```python
print(','.join(valid_numbers))
```

This takes all our stringified numbers and joins them into one big string, with commas in between.

**Run the Program:**

Now, save your file and let's run it. You should see a sequence of numbers displayed in your terminal or output window, all fitting our specified conditions.

**Now let's summarize What We've Done:**

We've just written our first Python script in this series. We've learned how to loop through a range of numbers, apply conditions to find specific numbers, store these numbers, and print them out beautifully.

Practice makes perfect. Try changing the range or the conditions to see how your output changes. Remember, each step forward is a step towards mastering Python.

Thank you for following along. I'll see you in our next lesson where we'll tackle another exciting challenge. Happy coding!
